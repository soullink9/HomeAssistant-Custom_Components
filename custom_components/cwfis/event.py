"""Fire alert event entity.

Fires an event when, for any fire inside any zone's alert radius:
  * new_fire_nearby - a fire appears inside the radius
  * stage_changed   - its stage of control changes (e.g. Being held -> Out of control)
  * fire_grew       - it grows by GROWTH_FACTOR and at least GROWTH_MIN_HA since the last alert
  * fire_out        - it disappears from the active list (declared out)

The entity's state is the time of the last event; use it as an automation trigger.
