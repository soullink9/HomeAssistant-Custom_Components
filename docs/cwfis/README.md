# Canadian Wildland Fire Information System (CWFIS)

Canada's national wildfire data in Home Assistant. See the national fire summary, every active fire on a map, how close fires are to you, and whether their smoke is likely to reach you. You don't need to live in Canada: smoke from Canadian fires regularly reaches the northern United States, which is why this was built.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up CWFIS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=cwfis)

- The **national summary**, matching the CWFIS homepage: fires reported today, active, out, total and area burned this season.
- **This season against last year**, at exactly the same point in the season.
- A **per-province breakdown**, with optional sensors for the provinces you care about.
- **How close fires are** to Home and to any other zones you pick (a cottage, family, a trip): the nearest fire, fires inside your alert radius, satellite hotspots and fire perimeters, prescribed burns and the local fire danger.
- **Fire alerts**: a new fire near you, a change in its stage of control, a big jump in size, or a fire declared out.
- **Smoke**: a 24- and 48-hour PM2.5 forecast for Home, a **fire upwind** check using your own wind sensor, and a **wildfire smoke** check using your own air-quality sensor.
- **Maps**: a marker for every active fire on Home Assistant's built-in Map card, plus optional Canada-wide maps of fire danger, smoke and hotspots.
- Setup and settings are done entirely in the UI, with no YAML, API keys or extra packages.

Everything appears on a single **CWFIS** device, ready for dashboards, automations and notifications. This is a hobby project, not an emergency alert system. For evacuations and safety decisions, always follow your local authorities.

## Install

**Needs:** Home Assistant 2026.3 or newer.

1. **Download.** Copy the [`custom_components/cwfis`](../../custom_components/cwfis) folder from this repository into `/config/custom_components/` and restart Home Assistant.
2. **Add the integration.** Go to Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → **Canadian Wildland Fire Information System**. It takes one click and uses your Home location.
3. **Configure.** Open the integration and choose **Configure** to set your alert and smoke radius, extra zones, your wind and PM2.5 sensors, provinces and maps. The [Settings](Settings.md) page helps you pick sensible distances.

## Privacy

There are no accounts, API keys or tracking. The integration only contacts Natural Resources Canada's fire data servers and Open-Meteo's air-quality forecast. To work out distances and the forecast, it sends the approximate coordinates of Home and your watch zones. The [Privacy](Privacy.md) page lists every request.
