# Installation

You need Home Assistant 2026.9 or newer and a Crafty Controller 4 that Home Assistant can reach over the network.

## Download

1. Copy the [`custom_components/crafty_controller`](../../custom_components/crafty_controller) folder from this repository into `/config/custom_components/`. The result must be:

   ```
   config/custom_components/crafty_controller/__init__.py
   config/custom_components/crafty_controller/manifest.json
   ...
   ```

2. **Restart Home Assistant.** A full restart is needed the first time. Reloading is not enough for a brand-new integration.

## Add the integration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration** and search for **Crafty Controller**.
2. Fill in the form (see [Configuration](Configuration.md)):
   - **URL** of your Crafty, for example `https://192.168.1.10:8443`
   - **API token**
   - **Verify SSL certificate**
3. When it connects, every Minecraft server in Crafty appears as a device.

Nothing showing up, or an error on the form? See [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md).
