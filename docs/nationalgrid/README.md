# National Grid for Home Assistant

Your National Grid (US) smart meter's electric usage and cost in Home Assistant, in 15-minute steps instead of
days behind. It takes over from the Opower integration's National Grid support, which stopped working when
National Grid changed its systems in early 2026.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up National Grid.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=nationalgrid)

- near-real-time usage from National Grid's 15-minute reads, checked every 15 minutes
- everything the Energy dashboard's grid entry asks for: energy imported, energy exported, cost, export credit
  and grid power
- all the history National Grid still has for your meter, imported on the first run
- estimates swapped for National Grid's exact meter readings once they're published, so past hours end up exact
- cost from your own bills (total charges ÷ kWh, so supply, delivery, taxes and fees are all in)
- no gaps or double counting through clock changes, outages and restarts

Setup is all in the UI: no YAML, no helpers to create.

## Install

**Needs:** Home Assistant 2026.9 or newer, a [National Grid online account](https://www.nationalgridus.com/), and
an electric smart meter. Gas meters, and electric meters without smart meter data, aren't supported.

1. **Download.** Copy the [`custom_components/nationalgrid`](../../custom_components/nationalgrid) folder from this repository into `/config/custom_components/` and restart Home Assistant.
2. **Sign in.** Press the button above, or go to **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → National Grid**, and enter the email and password you use on National Grid's website. The first start imports your history, which can take a few minutes.
3. **Connect the Energy dashboard.** The [Energy Dashboard](Energy-Dashboard.md) page shows what to pick for each field.

## Privacy

The integration only talks to National Grid, with the email and password you enter, which Home Assistant keeps
like any other integration's sign-in. Nothing goes anywhere else. See [Privacy](Privacy.md).

## Credits

This integration stands on other people's work:
- [py-nationalgrid](https://github.com/virtitnerd/py-nationalgrid) by virtitnerd (Apache-2.0) does all of the talking to National Grid: signing in, accounts, real-time and settled usage, and bills. It's installed automatically.
- [ha_nationalgrid](https://github.com/virtitnerd/ha_nationalgrid) by virtitnerd, a fork of [Ryan Morash's original integration](https://github.com/ryanmorash/ha_nationalgrid): this integration's approach came from studying it, in particular joining National Grid's settled readings with its real-time reads, working out cost rates from bill history (total charges ÷ kWh, blended over the last three bills), and the cookie setup National Grid's sign-in needs. Ryan Morash first worked out National Grid's new API, in [aionatgrid](https://github.com/ryanmorash/aionatgrid).
- Home Assistant's [Opower integration](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/opower) by tronikos: the pattern for writing usage, cost and compensation as long-term statistics for the Energy dashboard.

Everything else was written for this project, with help from Claude, Anthropic's AI model.
