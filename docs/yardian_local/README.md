# Yardian Local: fail-safe lawn watering

A local-only Home Assistant integration for Yardian sprinkler controllers, plus a blueprint that runs your watering schedule and keeps running safely when Home Assistant doesn't.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and import the watering blueprint.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsoullink9%2FHomeAssistant-Custom_Components%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fyardian%2Fyardian_lawn_schedule.yaml)

- **Local only**: talks to the controller on your network, never to the cloud
- **Fails safe**: every zone is started with a run time, so the controller stops it on its own even if Home Assistant goes down mid-cycle
- **Never waters twice in a day**, even after a crash or power cut, and picks up a missed start when Home Assistant or the controller comes back in time
- zone switches, run times, a stop-all button, and a safety watchdog that stops any zone left on too long
- start at a fixed time, or finish a set time before sunrise (calculated from your home location)
- a watering season, watering days, odd/even dates, and town rules (watering-allowed sensor, bans, drought level, trash pickup days)
- weather skips from your own rain, rain-rate and temperature sensors and an hourly forecast, all unit-aware
- estimated water use per zone and in total, ready for the **Energy dashboard**
- notifications to any of your phones, including season start and end reminders
- no YAML and no helpers to create: everything is set in the UI

## Install

**Needs:** Home Assistant 2026.9 or newer and a Yardian controller on your network with its access token (shown in the Yardian app).

1. **Download.** Copy the [`custom_components/yardian_local`](../../custom_components/yardian_local) folder from this repository into `/config/custom_components/` and restart Home Assistant.
2. **Add your controller.** Press the first button above, or go to **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → Yardian Local**, and enter its IP address and access token. If you use Home Assistant's built-in Yardian integration, remove it so the controller isn't polled twice.
3. **Set run times.** On the controller's device page, set each zone's **run time** (0 skips a zone) and the **Flow rate** if you want water estimates.
4. **Schedule.** Press the second button above to import the blueprint, then create an automation from it and pick your zones and the Stop all button. Every other setting is optional.

The [Installation](Installation.md) page has the details, including updating and removing.

## Privacy

Nothing calls out to the internet. The integration talks only to the controller's address you enter, on your own network. See [Privacy](Privacy.md).

## Credits
Work from other people in this project:
- The controller is reached through [pyyardian](https://github.com/aeon-matrix/pyyardian) by Aeon Matrix, installed as a dependency.
- `config_flow.py`, `coordinator.py`, the zone switches and the Standby sensor are adapted from Home Assistant's built-in [Yardian integration](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/yardian) (Home Assistant Core, [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/LICENSE.md)): the setup with host and access token, how the controller is polled and its errors handled, the zone's enabled flag, and reading standby from `iStandby`. The `start_irrigation` action keeps the built-in integration's name and limits so automations carry over.
- The blueprint's sunrise calculation uses NOAA's [General Solar Position Calculations](https://gml.noaa.gov/grad/solcalc/solareqns.PDF) (public domain).
- The integration's icon and logo are the Aeon Matrix logo. Yardian and Aeon Matrix are trademarks of Aeon Matrix; this project is not affiliated with or endorsed by them.
